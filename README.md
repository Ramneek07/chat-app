# chat-app

In this tutorial we are going to build a Full stack Chat App using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. This will be a real-time chat application. it means, when we send a message to another user, they will instantly receive the message without re-loading the application. 

For creating this real-time messaging feature we will use Socket.IO. It is a free and open-source library that enables real-time bi-direction communication between client app and server.

After building this Full stack chat app using reactjs, we will deploy it online for free, using vercel. so that anyone can access this web app and chat with other users.
